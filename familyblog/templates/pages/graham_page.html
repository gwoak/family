  We have several sources of good information, particularly on the
  Wiese/Watson side, and to a lesser extent on the Hinge side. We also know
  something of the history on the McLachlan side, but unfortunately not as much
  as we should. I clearly remember my grandmother sitting with Karin and me in
  her home back in the early 1980s, telling us stories about her parents and
  grandparents, but I didn’t write anything down and it’s all gone.

        <h3>Wiese family</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t intend to reproduce family history manuscripts here, but one
          document that gives a good account of the emigration of Friedrich and
          Johanne Wiese and four of their children from Osterwieck is available
          <a href="http://gtamk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/THE-WIESE-FAMILY-HISTORY.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. One of their sons was Gottfried Friedrich Heinrich Wiese, my
          great-grandfather. It goes through to their settlement in the Tatiara
          district, on farming land between today’s towns of Bordertown and
          Mundulla.

          This is a partial draft version of a book written by Annette Carter,
          named ‘Cosy Heart’ and self-published on Blurb. This draft is almost
          identical to the final text, but the illustrations are absent, and I
          have omitted all the content that covers the descendants of August
          Gottfried Friedrich Wiese who moved to WA. I have an extract from the
          book (pdf) that includes the illustrations on
          <a
            href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9n3kubrlfvvmq0k/Cosy%20Heart%20Extract.pdf?dl=0"

            >Dropbox (23Mb)</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next source we have is a book called ‘From Sea Coast to Gum
          Trees’, the history of the Edward Farrow family, published in 1993.
          Edward and Emily Farrow emigrated from Sussex in 1839, arriving at
          Adelaide in March 1840. Their daughter Amy Farrow married Robert
          Adamson, whose parents came from Yorkshire, and their only child Emma
          Amy Adamson married Gottfried. She is therefore my great-grandmother.
          So this book takes up the Gottfried Wiese story just where ‘Cosy
          Heart’ drops it and heads off to WA, and it has the family story right
          up to the late 1980s. It’s a mine of information, but I don’t have it
          in electronic form apart from
          <a

            >these scanned pages</a
          >
          from the Amy chapter (14Mb). I have included all Gottfried’s children,
          as there are interesting photos and stories on many of the pages that
          tell us about life around Mundulla and other places. They also tell me
          why my father always seemed to have a lot of aunts, uncles and cousins
          to visit.

        <h3>Watson family</h3>
        <p>
          Robert Wiese married Gertrude Frances Watson, the daughter of James
          Howell Watson and Catherine Frances Basham. The Watson family history
          is well documented in the book ‘Soldiers Farmers and Others: Watson
          Family History’ written by Terry Watson. That’s here in ebook format:
          <a href="http://gtamk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Soldiers,%20Farmers%20and%20Others_%20A%20Watson%20Fam%20-%20Terry%20Watson.epub" target="_blank">epub</a> which is the Apple iBooks format and fairly generic, or

          which works on Kindle (at least on the app, I haven’t got a reader).

          In summary, James Howell Watson’s father was Henry Jonas Watson, born
          in India and married to Mary Harris from Glamorgan. Henry’s father was
          Lt Henry Jonas Watson who was stationed on Réunion Island during the
          Napoleonic wars between France and Britain (Réunion is French, but was
          occupied by the British between 1810 and 1814). In 1813 Lt Henry Jonas
          married Mary Anne Joseph de Guigné Labérangerie, a 15 year old with
          some very interesting, mainly French, ancestors. The book has a
          chapter on the Réunion story, but you need to look at the family tree
          on this site to see a good diagram. There are documents attached to
          the tree with some good stories too, for example see Joseph de Guigné
          Labérangerie, who may have been a bit of a pirate, or Françoise
          Châtelain de Cressy (known as one of the ‘Grand-méres des
          Réunionnais’).
        </p>
        <p>
          The father of Lt Henry Jonas Watson was Lt Col Jonas Watson, who was
          killed in an ambush by Irish rebels at Three Rock Mountain, Co Wexford
          in 1798 (Battle of Three Rocks). He married Harriet Colclough, and it
          is her ancestry that you can trace back to King Edward III and others.
          Terry Watson has also written a book ‘Just a Small Drop’ covering
          this, but I have only a hard copy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Basham family also has an interesting history in Australia,
          although as far as I am aware nobody has written a book. Catherine
          Watson’s father was Charles Abraham Basham, born in 1826 in Tasmania
          (Van Diemen’s Land). His father was William Basham, born in London in
          1800 and the son of Zenophon Hearn Basham, a convict who was
          transported to NSW on the ‘General Hewett’, arriving in 1814. He was
          sent to Van Diemen’s Land soon after that. He was originally sentenced
          to 14 years transportation in 1811 for forgery, but he escaped from
          the prison hulks in Portsmouth on 31 Oct 1811. He was subsequently
          arrested and charged with being at large before the expiration of his
          term, for which he was sentenced to death, commuted to transportation.
          Charles Abraham Basham’s mother was Louisa (or Eliza) Tibbs, also born
          in London and the daughter of John Tibbs. Tibbs was also a convict,
          transported to NSW on the ‘Alexander’ in 1806. He took up land in Van
          Diemen’s Land after receiving his certificate of freedom in 1813.
          Charles Basham left the Launceston area for Adelaide in the early days
          of the SA colony, and eventually farmed land near Middleton, between
          Goolwa and Victor Harbour.

        <h3>Hinge family</h3>
        <p>
          John and Mary Hinge came originally from Somerset, then moved to South
          Wales for John to work in the coal mines. Unfortunately I didn’t know
          this when I lived in Bristol, as I am sure I could have tracked down
          some information about them. I guess my mother (Betty Hinge) didn’t
          know either, as she never mentioned it when she was with me there in
          1974 and 1975.
        </p>

        <p>
          Four of their nine children were born in Wales and accompanied them
          when they sailed for Port Adelaide, arriving in 1858. Afterwards they
          came to Robe by sea, then went on to the Tatiara in bullock wagons,
          eventually settling in Mundulla. Their second child was Albert; he
          married Mary Jane Broome, and their first surviving child was James,
          my grandfather. Albert, Mary and their other children lived in various
          parts of WA, while James lived in Bordertown. I don’t know the story
          behind this.
        </p>

        <p>
          A booklet on the Hinge family history was produced for a family
          reunion in 1982 held at Mundulla. It is little more than a record of
          descendants, but I have scanned

        <h3>McLachlan family</h3>
        <p>
          James Hinge married Nellie Olivia Gamblin McLachlan. Her father
          Archibald McLachlan came to South Australia as a teenager with his
          parents in 1883, when they emigrated from Scotland. His father, also
          Archibald, was born in Lochgilphead, Argyll, and his mother Jane
          Eglinton was born in Bothwell near Glasgow. Passenger lists available
          in the SA State Library show that their ship ‘Aldergrove’ left
          Plymouth on August 17 1883 and arrive in SA on October 31. Archibald
          senior is listed as ‘ordinary labourer’ although other records (e.g.
          his wife’s obituary published in The Advertiser) say he was a
          shipbuilder. Archibald junior is listed as a farm labourer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Olive (as she was known) was born in Terowie in the mid-north of SA,
          where her father Archibald worked in the railways (I think – he was
          certainly the stationmaster at Bute later in his life). Some details
          of the family are available in
          <a
            href="http://gtamk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McL_FamilyHistory.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >this document</a
          >. Her mother died when she was very young. Her father remarried, but
          I don’t think that was a happy event for her as there seemed to be
          some tension in the air when the later McLachlans were mentioned,
          while she always spoke very tenderly of her mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          On her mother’s side, her grandmother Mary Ann Gamlen was born in
          North Adelaide after her parents emigrated from Lincolnshire. I
          presume the Gamlen surname is the origin of her third name of Gamblin,
          but I don’t know when the spelling was adjusted. As far as I remember,
          she always spelled it that way. Mary Ann’s mother Charlotte Bidwell
          was born in Norfolk, while her father Eli Gamlen was born in Somerset.
          Both died in SA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary Ann Gamlen’s husband Alfred Brown was born in Lincolnshire, as
          were his parents. They emigrated to SA in 1855 on the ship ‘Punjab’
          from Southampton.
